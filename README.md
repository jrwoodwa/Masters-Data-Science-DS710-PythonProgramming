# Masters-Data-Science-DS710-PythonProgramming

I selected my final project as a proactive response to an impending layoff to explore the job market and make informed career development decisions following enrollment in a Data Science graduate program. The project uses data from diverse sources, including Wikipedia pages, a world location database, government URLs for visualizations, and LinkedIn job search postings. Ethical constraints led to hiring a contractor to scrape job description data. While acknowledging potential limitations and biases in the data, the project seeks answers to critical questions about job locations, salary ranges by state, and the prevalence of different degree levels in job listings. Ultimately, my goal with this project was to align with the goals of a data scientist career: enabling strategic job searching, skills prioritization, and confident resume optimization for a fulfilling career transition.
