Position Summary 

The University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI)is in search of motivated, innovative team members to further ongoing government artificial intelligence research applied to autonomy decision and execution services. The qualified candidate will join the Autonomy Systems Group on a hybrid schedule. 

We blend the use of common programming languages like Java, Python, and C++ with lesser known logic programming solvers and our own complex event processing domain-specific language. We wrap it all into a DevSecOps framework that deploys through containers and scales from edge platform computing up to the cloud. 

Our autonomy services support multiple echelons of dynamic mission planning and execution from the strategic level down through vehicle autonomy. Planners and operators at each level interact with the autonomy to define and refine their goals, preferences, and constraints. Using this intent together with context models and local information, the decision services reason over possibilities to determine the best course of action for the situation. 

The role will focus on developing autonomous agents that choose and execute courses of action in simulated scenarios and interact with the simulated environment. The qualified candidate will join a multidisciplinary team to model situations for decision services, develop agent behaviors, create task monitors, and integrate agents with other autonomy services. 

No candidate comes into our group with all of the skills that we use on a daily basis, so we invest in tutorials and mentoring. We are looking for candidates that bring pragmatic expertise in at least one aspect of what we do (e.g.: software development and integration, logic programming, game theory, optimization, ontologies, planning languages) and we will give you the opportunity to grow into the others. 

Minimum Qualifications 
BS in Computer Science, Engineering, Operations Research, Mathematics or similar discipline (or equivalent professional experience) 
Experience with ONE OR MORE of the following: 
Software development in object oriented language (e.g. Java, Python, C#, Rust) 
Logic or constraint programming (e.g. clingo, prolog, Z3, SAT solvers) 
Operations research modeling (e.g. OR-tools, CPLEX, LINGO) 
Planning domain language (e.g. PDDL) 
Game theory and optimization 
Ontology and linked data development (e.g. OWL, RDF) 
Effective communication skills 
Due to the nature of the work, candidate must be a * U.S. citizen and willing and able to obtain a DoD Secret security clearance 
Preferred Qualifications 

While not everyone may possess all of the preferred qualifications, the ideal candidate will bring many of the following: 
Advanced degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Operations Research, Mathematics, or similar discipline 
Practical experience with container virtualization and management technologies (e.g. Docker, K8s) 
Experience with applied artificial intelligence and autonomy technologies 
Experience with software development processes including source control, issue tracking, continuous integration, requirement flow 
Experience with multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) 
Experience with ontology development and management 
Special Instructions To Applicants 

To apply please submit a cover letter addressing each minimum qualification and any applicable preferred qualifications that you meet. 

A federal court on December 7, 2021, issued a ruling that suspends the COVID-19 vaccine requirement that applies to federal contractors nationwide. With this development, the University will pause any enforcement action against employees who have not complied with the requirement to be fully vaccinated by Dec. 8, 2021 or to have requested an exemption to maintain their employment status. 

The University will continue to monitor the state of the pandemic on campus and in the community as well as developments in federal and state requirements, and also will continue to regularly consult with public health officials and our medical panel. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, our protocols and requirements are subject to change depending on conditions on campus or in our community, and government requirements. 

Closing Statement 

Informed by its Catholic and Marianist mission, the University is committed to the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Informed by this commitment, we seek to increase diversity, achieve equitable outcomes, and model inclusion across our campus community. As an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer, we will not discriminate against minorities, women, protected veterans, individuals with disabilities, or on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation or gender identity.
